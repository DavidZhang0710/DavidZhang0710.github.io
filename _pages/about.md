Hi, welcome to my homepage. My name is Zhang Huangyu, and you can call me David. I'm now an undergraduate student from Xi'an Jiaotong Unversity, and my major is Computer Science. I'm interested in Machine Learning and Software Development.

When I was in the primary school, I was eager to playing computer games, and even find out some way to crack into the computer without any keyword. I think that was exactly when I begin to be interested in computer.

Currently, I'm work on my school final project about a system to evaluate the traffic flow automatically by Computer Vision.

If you have any ideas interesting, no matter is it related to computer, just come to me.

You can find my CV here: [Huangyu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
